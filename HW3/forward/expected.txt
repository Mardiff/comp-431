Hey Kevin, do you really think we should use SMTP as a class
project in COMP 431 this year? The smart students are going to
figure out automated ways to send anonymous SPAM to the world!

Dr. J, I just wanted to tell you that I think these SMTP
programming assignments are the coolest thing! I really like
learning how a real-life protocol for a real-life Internet service
really works.

Thanks!
